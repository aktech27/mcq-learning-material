Flow control is just a protocol that kicks in when the receiver receives a lot of messages at once, the protocol asks the transmitter to slow down the sending process. Addressing involves assigning the smaller bits data set an address header which enables the transmission process. Error control is a protocol that kicks in when erroneous data is received.
