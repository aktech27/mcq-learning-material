Cache memory is smaller in size compared to the main memory which makes memory transmission faster but the main use of cache memory is to store and supply the information which is being used very frequently. Thus instead of accessing the main memory, only the cache needs to be read from or called for to obtain the information in the fastest manner. This principle is known as ‘Locality by reference’.
